## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This was great challenge, as I learned a lot. First and foremost I learned render a new component frome a component, also send daTa with prop from the main app. Working with useState hook was challenging, selecting and toggling "li" items was very timeconsuming but al last I did it. 


### Continued development

I have to constinue working on the abovementiond challanges, and then take new ones.
